This is repository has all of the scripts to install ENux in your debian system.
This readme will teach you how to install ENux

IMPORTANT: BOTH OF THESE SCRIPTS NEEDS TO RUN ON ROOT. OR ELSE IT WON'T WORK

Step 0: Get a install Debian Linux in your system

Step 1: Open your terminal and git clone my repository

Step 2: After you git cloned my repository, you are going to locate "ENux-goodies". I recommend you do "ls" and "~". After you have located ENux-goodies, cd into and then run "sudo sh ./phase0.sh". It will create a desktop launcher for the
scripts. After that is done, you will follow the instroductions and after that, ENux will be succesfully installed
